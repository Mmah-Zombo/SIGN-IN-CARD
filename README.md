This is a simple sign in card made with HTML and CSS.

The image named "template.png" is the prototype of the card.

Give it a try.

CARD DETAILS

-User name can not exceed 50 characters
-The password can not exceed 20 characters
-The card is not responsive neither fully functional.

Creator's note: I might add more to the card; I'm considering
to make the clicking of the sign in button to do something. This will be done
with pure CSS and HTML. 

THANK YOU ❤💕❤💕
